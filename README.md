## Live Demo

Here is an [interactive demo](http://try-fhirplace.hospital-systems.com/fhirface/index.html),
which is build with [FHIRPlace](https://github.com/fhirbase/fhirplace/) & [FHIRFace](https://github.com/fhirbase/fhirface/) by-products.


## Motivation

While crafting Health IT systems you begin to understand a value of properly chosen domain model.
FHIR is an open source new generation lightweight standard for health data interoperability,
which (we hope) could be used as a foundation for Health IT systems. FHIR is based on a concept of __resource__.

> FHIR® is a next generation standards framework created by HL7.
> FHIR combines the best features of HL7 Version 2,
> Version 3 and CDA® product lines while leveraging the latest
> web standards and applying a tight focus on implementability.

Also we learned that data is a heart of any information system,
and should be reliably managed. PostgreSQL is battle proved open source
database, which supports structured documents (jsonb), while preserving
ACID guaranties and richness of SQL query language.

> PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system.
> It has more than 15 years of active development and a proven architecture
> that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness.

Here is list of PostgreSQL features we use:

* [xml](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/functions-xml.html)
* [jsonb](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/functions-json.html)
* [inheritance](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/tutorial-inheritance.html)
* [materialized views](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/sql-altermaterializedview.html)
* [uuid](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/pgcrypto.html)

We actively collaborate with PostgreSQL lead developers to craft production ready
storage for FHIR.

> Why we are doing this inside database?

We decided to implement most of FHIR specification inside database for
scalability reason (all data operations is done efficiently in databse).

This approach also gives you possibility use FHIRBase from your prefered lang/platform (.NET, java, ruby, nodejs etc).
We implemented FHIR compliant server in clojure, with small amount of code - [FHIRPlace](https://github.com/fhirbase/fhirplace/).

And there is option to break FHIR specification abstraction (if required) and
go into database by generic SQL interface and complete your business task.


## Features

## Overview

We heavily use PostgreSQL [inheritance](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/tutorial-inheritance.html) feature,
for polymorphic operations.

Here are base tables:

To store resource data:

* resource - for current resources
* resource_history - for resource historical versions
* tag - for tags
* tag_history - tags history

There are some "index" tables by one for each search parameter type and one for indexing all resource references,
which are populated in sync with resource data and  provide
fast FHIR search queries:

* search_string
* search_token
* search_date
* search_reference
* search_quantity
* references

For each resource type FHIRbase generate set of tables (which inherit from base tables).
This is done, to separate dataspaces for each resource, so they are not messed and
can guarantee performance proportional to amount of data for particular type of resource.

Note: Same trick is used by PostgreSQL for [partitioning](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/ddl-partitioning.html).


* "{{lower(ResourceType)}}" (...) INHERITS (resource)
* "{{lower(ResourceType)}}_history" (...) INHERITS (resource_history)
* "{{lower(ResourceType)}}_tag" (...) INHERITS (tag)
* "{{lower(ResourceType)}}_tag_history" (...) INHERITS tag_history

* "{{lower(ResourceType)}}_sort" (...)

* "{{lower(ResourceType)}}_search_string" (...)
* "{{lower(ResourceType)}}_search_token" (...)
* "{{lower(ResourceType)}}_search_date" (...)
* "{{lower(ResourceType)}}_search_reference" (...)
* "{{lower(ResourceType)}}_search_quantity" (...)
* "{{lower(ResourceType)}}_references" (...)

## Installation

Prefered way is docker - https://docker.com.

Install docker.

Here is auto builded public [image of fhirbase](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/fhirbase/fhirbase/):

To install fhirbase:

```
sudo docker.io run -d --name=fhirbase -t -p <mylocalport>:5432 fhirbase/fhirbase:latest

# check by connecting to database
psql -U fhirbase -h localhost -p <mylocalport> fhirbase
password> fhirbase

# or you can connect with your postgresql client: 
# user:fhirbase, password: fhirbase, host: localhost, port:<mylocalport>
```

## Build

Requirements:
* PostgreSQL 9.4 (http://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1522/)
* pgcrypto
* pg_trgm


You can download postgresql 9.4 pre-release or build Postgresql from source  on debian/ubuntu
and create local user cluster with:


```
source local_cfg.sh && ./install-postgres
```

NOTE: you can tune configuration in local_cfg.sh.

You can install FHIRBase:

```
source local_cfg.sh
echo 'CREATE DATABASE mydb' | psql postgres
psql mydb < fhirbase--1.0.sql
```

TODO: test script to verify installation

## API

Most of FHIR complaint operations could be done with FHIRBase procedures,
which guaranties data integrity and do heavy job for you.
All procedures have first parameter _cfg jsonb with configuration params.
Now there is only one paramenter [base] (Service Root URL): `{"base":"http:/myserver"}`

#### FUNCTION fhir_read(_cfg jsonb, _type_ varchar, _id_ uuid)
Read the current state of the resource
Return bundle with only one entry for uniformity;

#### FUNCTION fhir_create(_cfg jsonb, _type_ varchar, _resource_ jsonb, _tags_ jsonb)
Create a new resource with a server assigned id
 Return bundle with newly entry;

#### FUNCTION fhir_vread(_cfg jsonb, _type_ varchar, _id_ uuid, _vid_ uuid)
Read specific version of resource with _type_
Returns bundle with one entry;

#### FUNCTION fhir_update(_cfg jsonb, _type_ varchar, _id_ uuid, _vid_ uuid, _resource_ jsonb, _tags_ jsonb)
Update resource, creating new version
Returns bundle with one entry;

#### FUNCTION fhir_delete(_cfg jsonb, _type_ varchar, _id_ uuid)
DELETE resource by its id AND return deleted version
Return bundle with one deleted version entry ;

#### FUNCTION fhir_history(_cfg jsonb, _type_ varchar, _id_ uuid, _params_ jsonb)
Retrieve the changes history for a particular resource with logical id (_id_)
Return bundle with entries representing versions;

#### FUNCTION fhir_search(_cfg jsonb, _type_ varchar, _params_ jsonb)
Search in resources with _type_ by _params_
Returns bundle with entries;

#### FUNCTION fhir_conformance(_cfg jsonb)
Returns conformance resource jsonb;
